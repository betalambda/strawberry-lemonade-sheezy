# strawberry-lemonade-sheezy
The Strawberry Lemonade UserCSS for Sheezy.art

# What is this theme?
This is the Strawberry Lemonade theme I created for the website Sheezy.art. I tried to make it as 'sheezy-like' with the colors, but it's not perfect. This is my first, actual custom theme I made for sheezy, and the first one I'm making a Github page for.

# Prerequisites
You will need to use the Styl**us** extension to be able to use this theme, as well as other UserCSS themes made by others. You do **not** need to be a Basic+ subscriber to use UserCSS themes, just the Stylus extension.

# How to report Issues
A quick guide to tags:
- `bug` - Self explanatory. When something broke in my thing and I need to fix it.
- `documentation` - If there's something wrong with the documentation I have in the source code or if something needs explained better.
- `duplicate` - Also self explanatory, if this is a duplicate of a preexisting issue, then I'll mark it as such and point you to the original issue
- `good first issue` - Well written issues that should be looked at as an example of how to write issues. Idk if this will be used at all or not.
- `undocumented class` - Some classes are undocumented because generally I just don't know what it is or what it does. As such, I made it pure yellow so when I do find it, it sticks out like a sore thumb. A sore, mustard-covered thumb. Some of the classes might be unused but you might see a pure yellow element. If you do, *let me know so I can investigate, style it properly, and document it as needed.*
- `wont fix` - Self explanatory. Some issues are just out of my control (e.g something wrong with the site itself or someone else's thing is causing conflicts that only they can fix).
