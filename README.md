# strawberry-lemonade-sheezy
The Strawberry Lemonade UserCSS for Sheezy.art

# What is this theme?
This is the Strawberry Lemonade theme I created for the website Sheezy.art. I tried to make it as 'sheezy-like' with the colors, but it's not perfect. This is my first, actual custom theme I made for sheezy, and the first one I'm making a Github page for.

# Prerequisites
You will need to use the Styl**us** extension to be able to use this theme, as well as other UserCSS themes made by others. You do **not** need to be a Basic+ subscriber to use UserCSS themes, just the Stylus extension.
